# Rugpull

![](pull.gif)

# Roadmap

1. To the moon

# Tokenomics

- Fixed supply

# Todo

- Maybe make a holder contract, that holds all rugpull contracts. This contract mediates transaction to all other contracts. This way, we can use our native token and only 'approve' once. Theoretically, a gamble is only an investment and a return, so therefore we can make an interface that every smart contract inherits. That way we can only validate a contract once.

- Update contracts?

- Create Rugpull token
- Create a rugpull smart contract
  - Create function to transfor rugpull token to smart contract
  - Lock swapping for rugpulled addresses
  - Emit an event to listen on dapp
